      summary: Retrieve processing account
      description: |
        Use this method to retrieve information about a specific processing account.  

        To retrieve a processing account, you need its processingAccountId. Our gateway returned the processingAccountId in the response of the [Create Merchant Platform](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create) method or the [Create Processing Account](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create-processing-account) method.  

        **Note:** If you don't have the processingAccountId, use our [List Merchant Platform's Processing Accounts](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/list-processing-accounts) method to search for the processing account.  

        Our gateway returns the following information about the processing account:  

        -	Business information, including the Merchant Category Code (MCC), status of the processing account, and address of the business.  
        -	Processing information, including the merchant’s refund policies and card types that the merchant accepts.  
        -	Funding information, including funding schedules, funding fees, and details for the merchant’s funding accounts.  
        -	Pricing information, including [HATEOAS](https://docs.payroc.com/knowledge/basic-concepts/hypermedia-as-the-engine-of-application-state-hateoas) links to retrieve the pricing program for the processing account.

      summary: Create reminder for processing account
      description: | 
        When you create a processing account, we send a copy of the pricing agreement to the merchant to sign. You can choose to send them a copy of the pricing agreement by email, or you can generate a link to the pricing agreement.<br/>  
        If you requested the merchant's signature by email and they don't respond, use our Reminders endpoint to create a reminder and to send another email.<br/>  
        **Note:** You can use the Reminders endpoint only if you request the merchant's signature by email. If you generate a link to the pricing agreement, you can't use the Reminders endpoint.
