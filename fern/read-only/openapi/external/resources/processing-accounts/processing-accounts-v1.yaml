      summary: Retrieve processing account
      description: |
        Use this method to retrieve information about a specific processing account.  

        To retrieve a processing account, you need its processingAccountId. Our gateway returned the processingAccountId in the response of the [Create Merchant Platform](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create) method or the [Create Processing Account](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create-processing-account) method.  

        **Note:** If you don't have the processingAccountId, use our [List Merchant Platform's Processing Accounts](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/list-processing-accounts) method to search for the processing account.  

        Our gateway returns the following information about the processing account:  

        -	Business information, including the Merchant Category Code (MCC), status of the processing account, and address of the business.  
        -	Processing information, including the merchant’s refund policies and card types that the merchant accepts.  
        -	Funding information, including funding schedules, funding fees, and details for the merchant’s funding accounts.  
        -	Pricing information, including [HATEOAS](https://docs.payroc.com/knowledge/basic-concepts/hypermedia-as-the-engine-of-application-state-hateoas) links to retrieve the pricing program for the processing account.

      summary: List processing terminals
      description: |
        Use this method to return a [paginated](https://docs.payroc.com/api/pagination) list of processing terminals associated with a processing account.  

        **Note:** If you want to view the details of a specific processing terminal and you have its processingTerminalId, use our [Retrieve Processing Terminal](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/processing-terminals/retrieve) method.  

        To list the terminals for a processing account, you need its processingAccountId. If you don't have the processingAccountId, use our [List Merchant Platforms](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/list) method to search for a merchant platform and its processing accounts.   
        
        Our gateway returns the following information for each processing terminal in the list:  

        - Status indicating whether the terminal is active or inactive.  
        - Configuration settings, including gateway settings and application settings.  
        - Features, receipt settings, and security settings.  
        - Devices that use the processing terminal's configuration.  

        For each processing terminal, we also return its processingTerminalId, which you can use to perform follow-on actions.

      summary: Create reminder for processing account
      description: | 
        Use this method to prompt a merchant to sign their pricing agreement.  

        You can create a reminder only if you requested the merchant’s signature by email when you created the processing account for the merchant.  

        To create a reminder, you need the processingAccountId. Our gateway returned the processingAccountId in the response of the [Create Merchant Platform](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create) method or [Create Processing Account](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create-processing-account) method. 
        
        **Note:** If you don’t know the processingAccountId, use our [List Merchant Platform’s Processing Accounts](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/list-processing-accounts) method to search for the processing account.  

        When you send a successful request, we send an email to the merchant that prompts them to sign their pricing agreement.
