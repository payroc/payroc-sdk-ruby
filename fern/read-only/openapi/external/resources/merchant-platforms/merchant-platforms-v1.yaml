      A merchant platform is an entity that represents a business and includes its legal information and all processing accounts.<br/><br/>
      After you create a merchant platform for a business, you can do the following:  
        - [Create and add an additional processing account to a merchant platform.](#createProcessingAccount)  
        - [Retrieve a merchant platform.](#getMerchantAcccounts)  
        - [Retrieve a list of merchant platforms.](#listMerchantPlatforms)  
        - [Retrieve a list of open processing accounts that are linked to a merchant platform.](#listMerchantLocations)  
          
          
      For more information about boarding a merchant, go to our [Board a merchant](/guides/integrate/boarding) guide.

        Use this method to create the entity that represents a business, including its legal information and all its processing accounts.  

        > **Note:** To add a processing account to an existing merchant platform, go to [Create a processing account](/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create-processing-account).  
          
        The response contains some fields that we require for other methods:  
        - **merchantPlatformId** - Unique identifier that we assign to the merchant platform. Use the merchantPlatformId to retrieve and update information about the merchant platform.  
          
        - **processingAccountId**- Unique identifier that we assign to each processing account. Use the processingAccountId to retrieve and update information about the processing account.

        Use this method to add an additional processing account to a merchant platform.  

        To add a processing account to a merchant platform, you need the merchantPlatformId. Our gateway returned the merchantPlatformId in the response of the [Create Merchant Platform](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create) method.  

        **Note**: If you don't have the merchantPlatformId, use our [List Merchant Platforms](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/list) method to search for the merchant platform.  

        In the request, include the following information:  
        - Business details, including its business type, time zone, and address.  
        - Owners' details, including their contact details.  
        - Funding, pricing, and processing information, including its pricing model and funding accounts.  

        When you send a successful request, we review the information about the processing account. After we complete our review and approve the processing account, we assign a processingAccountId, which you need to perform follow-on actions.  

        **Note**: You can subscribe to our processingAccount.status.changed event to get notifications when we update the status of a processing account. For more information about how to subscribe to events, go to [Events List](https://docs.payroc.com/knowledge/events/events-list).
