      Create an event subscription so that we notify you when certain events occur, for example, when we change the status of a processing account.  
      When you subscribe to an event, provide the following information:  
        - **Event type** - The events that we should notify you about. You can subscribe to more than one event within the same request. For a list of events that you can subscribe to, go to [Events](https://docs.payroc.com/knowledge/basic-concepts/events).  
        - **Notification method** - The endpoint that we send a notification to if an event occurs. We send notifications by webhook request.  
        - **Event status** - The status of the event subscription.  
        - **Support email address** - Email address of the person or team that we contact if we can't deliver notifications.  

      Use our event subscriptions endpoint to do the following:  
      - [**Create event subscription**](#createEventSubscription) - Subscribe to receive notifications when events occur.  
      - [**Update event subscription**](#updateEventSubscription) - Change the details of an event subscription, for example, to receive notifications for an additional event.  
      - [**Partially update event subscription**](#patchEventSubscription) - Change values of an existing event subscription.  
      - [**Retrieve an event subscription**](#getEventSubscription) - Retrieve all the information that we stored in an event subscription.  
      - [**List event subscriptions**](#listEventSubscriptions) - Retrieve a list of all event subscriptions associated with the ISV's account.  
      - [**Delete event subscription**](#deleteEventSubscription)

        Use this method to return a [paginated](https://docs.payroc.com/api/pagination) list of event subscriptions that are linked to your ISV account.  
        
        **Note:** If you want to view the details of a specific event subscription and you have its id, use our [Retrieve Event Subscription](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/notifications/event-subscriptions/retrieve) method.  

        Use query parameters to filter the list of results that we return, for example, to search for subscriptions with a specific status or an event type.  

        Our gateway returns the following information about each subscription in the list:  
        - Event types that you have subscribed to.  
        - Whether you have enabled notifications for the subscription.  
        - How we contact you when an event occurs, including the endpoint that send notifications to.  
        - If there are any issues when we try to send you a notification, for example, if we can't contact your endpoint.  

        For each event subscription, we also return its id, which you can use to perform follow-on actions.
