# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Payroc takes the security of our products and SDKs seriously.

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in this repository or any Payroc SDK, **please do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report the issue in accordance with our official Security Disclosure Policy:

👉 https://payroc.com/legal/security-disclosure-policy/

That policy describes:

- How to submit a vulnerability report
- What information to include
- Our coordinated disclosure process and expectations

Thank you for helping keep Payroc and our customers secure.
